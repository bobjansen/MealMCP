| **Page Speed** | Slow (heavy JS) | Fast (minimal JS) |
| **Mobile UX** | Poor | ✅ Excellent |
| **Debugging** | Complex | ✅ Simple |
| **Maintenance** | Difficult | ✅ Easy |

## 🚧 **Next Steps**

The Flask version is fully functional and ready to use. The original Dash app (`app.py`) has been preserved for reference but the Flask version (`app_flask.py`) is now the recommended way to run the application.

### 🗂️ **File Cleanup** (Optional)
If you want to clean up the old Dash files:
```bash
# Archive the old Dash app
mv app.py app_dash_legacy.py

# Rename Flask app to be the main app
mv app_flask.py app.py
```

## 🎉 **Conclusion**

The migration to Flask has solved all the callback issues and provides a much better foundation for future development. The edit recipe functionality now works perfectly, and the overall user experience is significantly improved!

**You can now edit recipes without any problems!** 🎊
