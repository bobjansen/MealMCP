# Goal of this project

Manage meal planning and pantry management using an LLM for business logic.

# Datastore

The code should be data store agnostic but we will start out using sqlite.

# User interface

The app should be usable through the Claude Desktop client or through a Dash website that uses API calling.

# Status

At the moment, the project is empty. It will be written in Python and be managed using uv.
